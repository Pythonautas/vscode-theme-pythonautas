## ðŸ”— Community

Pythonautas is a movement that emerged on June 26, 2018, driven by my desire to help people learn programming. It was born out of my wish to offer free support, independent of the company I was working for, to those who completed the course. My goal was to make people's dreams of becoming developers a reality. Initially, I was solely responsible for providing this support, but as the number of interested individuals grew, I realized that a more collaborative approach was necessary. That's when I had the brilliant idea to connect experienced former students with new students so they could share knowledge and support.

Thanks to the incredible support and dedication of all the members, we have become a community of Pythonautas. I found the motivation I needed to write a Python book. I would like to extend an invitation to you to join this amazing community. Here, you will find a warm and welcoming community ready to clarify your doubts throughout your learning journey. We are Pythonautas, a valuable tool to help you achieve your goals in the world of technology. Follow our social media channels to become an active member of this inspiring community.
